Assignment
1.Write a program that will find factors of the given number and find whether the factor is even or odd.
Hint: Use Loop with if-else statements


	Solution
		num=20
for i in range(1,num+1):
  			  rem=num%i
   			 if(rem==0):
       				 if(i%2==0):
            					print(i,"is an even factor")
       				 else:
            					print(i,"is an odd factor")
    			else:
       				 pass


2.Write a code that accepts a sequence of words as input and prints the words in a sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
                   Hint: Use split() to split the string into a list and then apply sort()

        Solution
my_string = "Welcome to Edureka"
# breakdown the string into a list of words
words = my_string.split()
# sort the list
words.sort()
# display the sorted words
print("The sorted words are:")
for word in words:
    print(word)
	

3.Write a program that will find all the numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both excluded) such that each digit of a number is an odd number. Print the number of such elements


Solution

	numbers_list = []
                        for i in range(1001,3000):
                        		s = str(i)
                                     if (int(s[0])%2!=0) and (int(s[1])%2!=0) and (int(s[2])%2!=0) and           (int(s[3])%2!=0):
                  numbers_list.append(s)
      print('The length of the list is:',len(numbers_list))



4.Write a program that accepts a string and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose if the entered string is: Edureka123
Then the output will be:
LETTERS: - 7
DIGITS: - 3

Solution
